\description{
Apples of each of six types (Aomori--Fuji, Aomori--Jona, Aomori--Ohrin, NZ--Envy, NZ--Jazz, NZ--Fuji) 
were blended and filtered using a gauze. Fluorescence profiles of complete excitation--emission matrix 
of filtered solutions (diluted with water to 147 times) were measured using fluorescence spectroscopy machines. The sample name refers to "type--fruit number--replicate". To save space, only two apples of each types were given in the dataset.
