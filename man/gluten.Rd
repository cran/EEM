\description{
Pure wheat gluten and pure wheat starch were mixed at gluten ratios ranging from 0 to 100 \%, in 20 \% increments. The samples were set in a cell with a quartz glass window, and the samples were pressed against the glass to obtain a flat surface. This dataset contains fluorescence excitation-emission profiles of each samples with 8 replicates. To save space, only the data with gluten ratios ranging from 0 to 60 \% was provided.
